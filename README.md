### What is REPLNET?
Originally developed on repl.it, REPLNET is a web of sites, the most famous of which is 5282, which gives fullscreen functions and much more. 5282 works by `<iframe>` exploitation.
### Now, you have three choices:
+ Stay here, on Mkupolo1493.github.io
+ Visit [The Original REPLNET](https://repl.it/@3941driB/HTMLFRP) and open it in a new tab, or press [here](https://htmlfrp--3941drib.repl.co)
+ Visit [5282 on repl.co](https://5282--3941drib.repl.co)
### What are `<iframe>`s?
An `<iframe>` is an HTML tag which basically opens a webpage inside another webpage. Try this out:
1. [Google](https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on) about how `<iframe>`s work.
2. Make an `<iframe>` tag with width of 100%, height of 100%, and src of "[https://krunker.io](https://krunker.io)".
3. Have fun playing Krunker!
4. Install Securly or another page blocker extension.
5. Try it again.
It will still work! However, you can't just open [krunker.io](https://krunker.io) in a new tab, because the page blocker will block the game.
###### That is how `<iframe>` exploitation works.
### How does it work behind the scenes?
Nice question. It doesn't matter where the page comes from. It can come from google.com, repl.it, cssdesk.com, github.com, localhost or pretty much anything that isn't blacklisted. Here is what happens:
1. The server sends a request to the blocked page server. The blocked server returns tons of stuff. You see it in the `<iframe>`, again returned by the webpage server.
2. You send input to the `<iframe>`. Your computer sends the information about your input to the server, and the server sends the input to the blocked server.
3. The server that gave you the web page is now the middleman between you and the blocked page. If you make it fullscreen, it will look to you like you're directly interacting with the page, minus the tiny bit of lag, but Securly (or another *stupid and annoying* page blocker) will only see, for example, cssdesk.com.
